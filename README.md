# Doom Emacs

This repository is a fork of [doom emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs). 

**Why I decide to make a fork of doom emacs?**

I use emacs for my daily use, and doom emacs's default setup is yet (a liitle bit) away from my expectation (my own workflow, of course). That's why I decide to make a fork of doom emacs, and stablize what I need to use everyday to avoid unexecpted behaviors. 

**My workflow (on MacOS):**

- Coding: C++/C development with [bazel](https://bazel.build/) build system, with [clangd](https://clangd.llvm.org/) as my lsp for code navigation, formating, ...
- Note-Taking: **a lot of latex math equations** with a lot of papers and references, with [zotero](https://www.zotero.org/)
- Task-Scheduling: **mixed research and engineering** items
